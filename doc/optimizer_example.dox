Consider the following optimization problem
\f{align*}{
    \min_x f(x) &= -(x1-2)^2, \: \text{s.t.}\\
    0&= 0 = x_0^2 + x_1 - 1\\
    -1 &<= x0 <= 1
\f}

We want to solve this using the \ref gsOptimizer and \ref gsOptProblem classes.

The definition of the derived class \a gsOptProblemExample is given by the \a OptProblemExample class

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample Class

In this class, the constructor is defined as:

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample Constructor

Here, it can be seen that the member \a m_numDesignVars is defined, representing the number of design variables, as well as the members \a m_numConstraints and \a m_numConJacNonzero which respectively represent the number of constraints and the number of non-zeros in the Jacobian matrix. In addition, the members \a m_desLowerBounds and \a m_desUpperBounds respectively give the lower and upper bounds of the design variables. Similarly, the constraint bounds can be defined by \a m_conLowerBounds and \a m_conUpperBounds.

In addition, the evaluation of the objective function is defined as follows:

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample evalObj

And the gradient is defined below

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample gradObj_into

The evaluation of the constraint function is

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample evalCon_into

As well as its Jacobian

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp OptProblemExample jacobCon_into

In the main part of the code, the optimizers can be defined. Since \ref gsOptimizer serves as a base class, they can be allocated by pointers; based on a small switch-case statement:

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp Optimizer selection

Accordingly, the initial solution can be defined

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp Initial solution

And the problem can be solved

\snippet optimizer_example.cpp Solve

The output is printed as follows
