\gismo (Geometry + Simulation Modules, pronounced "gismo") is an open-source C++ library that brings together mathematical tools for geometric design and numerical simulation. It implements the relatively new paradigm of isogeometric analysis, which suggests the use of a unified framework in the design and analysis pipeline. \gismo is an object-oriented, cross-platform, template C++ library and follows the generic programming principle, with a focus on both efficiency and ease of use. The library aims at providing access to high quality, open-source software to the forming isogeometric numerical simulation community and beyond.

The library is licenced under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0" target="_blank">Mozilla Public License Version 2.0</a>.
