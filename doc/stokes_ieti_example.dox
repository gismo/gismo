We consider a Stokes boundary value problem with both Dirichlet (inflow / no-slip) and
Neumann boundary conditions. The computational domain is \f$\Omega\subset \mathbb R^d\f$.
The variational problem characterizing velocity \f$u\f$ and pressure \f$p\f$ is as follows:
Find \f$ (u,p) \in V \times Q = [H^1_{0,D}(\Omega)]^d \times L^2(\Omega)\f$ such that
\f[\begin{eqnarray}
    \int_\Omega \nabla u : \nabla v d x & + & \int_\Omega p \nabla \cdot v d x & = & \int_{\Gamma_N} g \cdot v dx \\
    & & \int_\Omega q \nabla \cdot u d x & = & 0
\end{eqnarray}\f]
for all \f$ (v,q) \in V \times Q \f$. The domain \f$ \Omega \f$ is composed of non-overlapping
patches \f$ \Omega_k \f$.

The theoretical framework follows the paper J. Sogn and S. Takacs. Stable discretizations and IETI-DP
solvers for the Stokes system in multi-patch Isogeometric Analysis. ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and
Numerical Analysis, vol. 57 (2), p. 921 â€“ 925, 2023.

We discretize using the Galerkin principle, i.e., by choosing \f$ V_h \times Q_h \subset V \times Q \f$.
Since the Stokes equations are a saddle point problem, we have to choose a pair of spaces that is
inf-sup stable.

For the individual patches \f$ \Omega_k \f$, we choose the Taylor-Hood spaces, i.e., \f$ V_h \f$ is composed of
splines of degree \f$ p+1 \f$ and smoothnes \f$ C^{p-1} \f$, and \f$ Q_h \f$ is composed of
splines of degree \f$ p \f$ and smoothnes \f$ C^{p-1} \f$. Both spaces use the same grid (breakpoints).

The global space is constructed as follows. Since the velocity space is in \f$ H^1 \f$, we need continuity
for the velocity. On each patch, we have a isogeometric function space \f$ V_k \f$. We assume that the
function spaces are *fully matching*. The global function space is
\f[
        V_h = \{ v\in [H^1_{0,D}(\Omega)]^d \;:\;  v|_{\Omega_k} \in V_k \}.
\f]
For the pressure, we only need \f$ L^2 \f$, so we choose a discontinuous space
\f[
        Q_h = \{ q\in L^2(\Omega) \;:\;  v|_{\Omega_k} \in Q_k \}.
\f]

The solution with the IETI-Solver is analogous to the file \c ieti_example.cpp. Here, we only discuss
the changes that have to be made to solve the Stokes equations, as opposed to the Poisson equation (as in
\c itei_example.cpp).

We first start by setting up one \a gsMultiBasis object for each velocity component and one for the
pressure; these are collected in a vector.

Analogously, we set up one \a gsIetiMapper object for each velocity component and one for the pressure.
For the setup of the corresponding \a gsDofMapper objects, we use instances of an appropriate assembler.
Here, we choose that the pressure is discontinuous:

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Define Mapper

As primal degrees of freedom, we choose the corner values and edge averages of the velocity components.
Additionally, we use the averages of the pressure (on each of the patches as primals), see paper for a
corresponding motivation.

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Define Primals

As opposed to the \a gsIetiMapper objects, we only have one \a gsIetiSystem, only one
\a gsScaledDirichletPrec and only one \a gsPrimalSystem.

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Define System2

For each patch, the local Stokes system is assembled with the \a gsExpressionAssembler:

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Assemble

This assembler yields a matrix, representing (for \f$d=2\f$) the linear system
\f[
        A_k :=
        \begin{pmatrix}
            K_k   &         &  D_{x,k}^\top \\
                  &   K_k   &  D_{y,k}^\top \\
          D_{x,k} & D_{y,k} &
        \end{pmatrix},
\f]
where \f$ K_k \f$ is a standard grad-grad-stiffness matrix (as for the Poisson problem) and \f$ D_{x,k} \f$
and \f$ D_{y,k} \f$ represent \f$ \int \partial_x u p dx \f$ and \f$ \int \partial_y u p dx \f$
respectively. If we would not have primal dofs, this matrix could be directly handed over to the
\a gsIetiSystem.

The matrices that are provided by the \a gsIetiMapper objects refer to scaler problems. Therefore,
they have to be combined accordingly: the jump matrices for the Stokes system are block-diagonal
combinations of the jump matrices for the individual variables. Analogously, the vectors and indices
for the primal degrees of freedom have to be handled. This is done by the called functions.

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Primals

In the example \c ieti_example.cpp, we have chosen the corresponding Dirichlet problem for the
scaled Dirichlet preconditioner. While this is also possible for the Stokes equations (altough in
this case, one has to deal with the fact that the pressure has to be restricted
to \f$ L^2_0(\Omega_k) \f$), an alternative has been proven it self to be more efficient. Here,
we make use of the fact that the scaled Dirichlet preconditioner should represent \f$ H^{1/2} \f$
on the skeleton, both for the Poision and the Stokes equations. This can be achived by just considering
a (vector-valued) Poisson problem (which is much cheaper to solve than the Stokes equations, see
the paper more details. We do not need to assemble matrix for the Poission problem, we just take the
upper-left part of \f$ A_k \f$ that consists of \f$ diag( K_k, K_k ) \f$.

Now, the data can be provided to the \a gsIetiSystem and the \a gsPrimalSystem as for the Poisson problem.

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Register

Also the setup of the primal system is done as for the Poisson problem. More work would be necessary
here if the problem only had Dirichlet conditions: In that case, we would have \f$ Q = L^2_0(\Omega) \f$,
so we would need to specify that the average pressure vanishes, i.e., \f$ \int_\Omega p dx = 0 \f$.
This can be formulated as a constraint in the primal system.

\snippet stokes_ieti_example.cpp Register primal

Since the Schur complement formulation is symmetric and positive definite, we can apply a preconditioned
conjugate gradient solver.
