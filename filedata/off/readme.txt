Letters.zip Readme File
This zip file contains 26 OFF files. Each one is a 3D
representation of each of the 26 digits A to Z. The
letters are each within the bounding box (0,0,0)-(3,5,1),
facing toward the positive z. These files were created
for use with my RoffView and related OFF-processing 
programs. They may be freely used and distributed. I
ask that you give credit if you use them, that you
keep this file with any distribution, and that you
e-mail me and let me know if you use them in anything
interesting.
